    <h2>Released in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris is a timeless puzzle game that has achieved global recognition and enduring popularity. Its simple yet addictive gameplay has made it a staple in the gaming world and a foundational piece of video game history. Tetris's influence spans decades, and it remains one of the most beloved and iconic games ever created.</h2>

    <p>Tetris challenges players with a straightforward yet deeply engaging concept: rotating and placing falling tetrominoes (geometric shapes composed of four blocks each) to create complete lines on a grid. When a horizontal line is completed, it disappears, earning the player points and making room for more shapes. The game’s objective is to prevent the grid from filling up, which results in a game over.

        The gameplay of Tetris is characterized by its elegance and simplicity. Players must quickly decide how to fit the falling pieces into the grid while anticipating future shapes and planning their moves strategically. The game speeds up as players progress, increasing the challenge and maintaining a constant level of engagement.
        
        Tetris is renowned for its intuitive controls and easy-to-understand mechanics. However, its deceptively simple design hides a depth of strategy and skill. The game’s balance of accessibility and challenge makes it enjoyable for both casual players and dedicated enthusiasts.
        
        The game’s visual and audio design is minimalist, yet effective. The iconic tetrominoes and the game’s familiar music and sound effects have become deeply ingrained in popular culture. The game's visual simplicity and catchy tune contribute to its lasting appeal and recognition.</p>
