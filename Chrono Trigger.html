    <h2>Released in 1995 by Square Enix (formerly Squaresoft) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Chrono Trigger is a seminal title in the RPG genre, celebrated for its innovative gameplay, compelling story, and memorable characters. Often regarded as one of the greatest video games ever made, Chrono Trigger set new standards for storytelling and design in role-playing games. Its legacy endures through its influential mechanics and enduring fan base.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Chrono Trigger takes players on a time-traveling adventure that spans several eras, from the prehistoric age to a post-apocalyptic future. The game follows the journey of Crono, a young hero who inadvertently finds himself at the center of a time-traveling quest to prevent a global catastrophe. Alongside Crono, players encounter a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique abilities and backstories.

        The game’s narrative is non-linear, allowing players to explore different time periods and make choices that influence the story's outcome. The plot is enriched by multiple endings, which are determined by the player’s decisions and actions throughout the game. This branching storyline encourages replayability, as players can experience different aspects of the game’s plot by making different choices.
        
        Chrono Trigger is notable for its innovative battle system, which combines traditional turn-based mechanics with real-time elements. The game’s “Active Time Battle” system requires players to make strategic decisions in real-time, adding a layer of intensity to combat encounters. Additionally, the game features “Tech” abilities, which are special attacks that can be combined with those of other characters to create powerful “Dual” and “Triple” Techs, adding depth to the tactical aspects of the game.
        
        The game's visual design is characterized by its beautiful 16-bit sprite graphics, which, combined with the atmospheric soundtrack composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, create a richly immersive experience. The art style and music have become iconic, contributing to the game’s lasting appeal.</p>
